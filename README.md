# Hanoi Tower

This repository provides several implementations of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle in different programming languages. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
